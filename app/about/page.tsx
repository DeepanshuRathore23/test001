                            The school has a profound belief that an all-round personality and the grooming of the learners is the core function of the school. It is the learning with a mix of curricular and co- curricular activities which reaches beyond the classroom teaching process. The school believes that the healthy growth of the students with a positive approach, positive attitude and intellectually sound minds is more important than the normative approach towards life. Our approach to education is student centred and we encourage participative learning.
